A Brobot application can then\nbe mocked to produce text outputs and is run exactly as it would otherwise. The higher level\ncode in a brobot application does not know if it is running live or in a mock. The mocks\nhappen only at the wrapper level and the wrappers return the same outputs as they would\nduring a real run (plus some additional logging when enabled).
