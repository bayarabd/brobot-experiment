At the same time, it would be more fun if we\ndidn't completely suck at the game. At this point I was in the second year of my degree,\nand the theoretical classes had graciously made space for a few practical classes\nfocused on programming, dependency injection, and other goodies such as\nobject calisthenics. I needed a personal project to practice what I was learning. I\nneeded a sidekick to help me up the learning curve, an Igor to my Frankenstein,\na Piglet for my Pooh, a Donkey to my Shrek, a Hobbes to my Calvin, a Bender for my Fry.\nI soon started calling my sidekick Brobot, and the name stuck.
