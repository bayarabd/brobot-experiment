Similar to a\nprogrammatic API, a Visual API can be accessed with code and manipulated with the GUI automation tools\nprovided by Brobot. To give an example, Starcraft made a programmatic API available to AI researchers\nto test reinforcement learning techniques. What if Starcraft hadn't made an API available yet you\nwanted to use the game to test your AI? Brobot attempts to solve this problem by converting visual cues\ninto a programmatic API.

Previous to Brobot, this was not possible,\nmaking the development of large automation applications very difficult due to the highly stochastic nature\nof automation. Think about it like this: You have a written an application that\ndepends on an external API in almost every single function of your program, and the output of the external\nAPI is highly variable. How do you test your codebase in this case? Well, traditionally, you would write\na mock test for each call to the external API, simulating the variability available in its output. While\ndifferent functions of the API are called in almost every single function call in your program, the test\ncode would quickly outgrow the underlying program code. This is also true for testing an automation application.\nWithout Brobot, to test an automation app, the environment's output would need to be simulated at every step,\nmaking the test code larger and more complex than the automation application.

Both Sikuli and Selenium can automate process flows in\nWeb sites, but they do it differently. Sikuli recognizes images and can click\non these images or use the scroll bar to navegate through a Web site. Selenium\naccesses the html of the Web site and manipulates Web objects directly. The process\nSikuli uses is a stochastic process since it is not sure to recognize an image\ncorrectly and attempting to drag the scroll bar is not guaranteed to actually scroll\nthe page. In contrast, the process Selenium uses is guaranteed to succeed since\nSelenium is working with the html objects themselves and not their representations.\nSo why would anyone use Sikuli to automate the use of Web pages if it introduces\nadded complexity? In short, you shouldn't use Sikuli to automate Web pages. Sikuli\nshould be used only where Selenium cannot be used, which is everywhere outside\nof the Web. Outside of the Web, most programs do not provide an API for\ndevelopers to manipulate the program's objects directly. The only way to automate\nthese programs is to interact with the program in the same way a person\nwould: by looking at the screen and using the mouse and keyboard."),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"the-difficulties-in-testing-a-stochastic-process"},"The Difficulties in Testing a Stochastic Process"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"But why aren't these applications tested during development? Well, how?\nHow do you test if your automation app will correctly scroll down on the page?\nTraditionally this was done through trial and error. A developer would code the\napp to scroll down and then run it to see if it worked. This is ok for small\napplications, but when an app becomes complex this is a huge problem for\ndevelopment. The longer it takes to recognize an error, the more time-consuming\nand frustrating the development process will be. Also, code in a process automation app\nis highly interdependent, meaning that changes in one part of the code base will\naffect the functionality in other parts. Not scrolling correctly will affect the\nsuccess of the code tasked with what to do at the bottom of the page. With GUI\nautomation, potential errors are everywhere. Recognizing the minimize window button\nby mistake could result in a minimized program window and your automation\napp being unable to continue. Another program could pop up a window in front of your\ntarget program to ask the user to confirm an update. The existence of uncertainty\nis what defines this process as stochastic, and it adds a lot of complexity to\nthe development of automation applications."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
